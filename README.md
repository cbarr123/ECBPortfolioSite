Welcome to my portfolio site.

About Me
I have been interested in technology for many years and have had the opportunity to work in technology related companies and roles. In my previous roles I have tended to be more focused on client facing responsibilities such as a sales engineer and marketing management. During all this time, I have always been drawn to the technology side of the business. 

Over the past year I began to do some online self-study courses and learned that I really enjoyed it. I am ready for a new adventure and have enjoyed the opportunity to dive deeper into technology and learning to code.  I am fascinated by coding and increasingly passionate about the idea of solving problems with technology.
